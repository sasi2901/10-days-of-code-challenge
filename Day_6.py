names()  #CALLING the function
#Here Indentation is mandatory - indentation is nothing but a blank or empty space at the beginning of a written or printed line or paragraph.

# ******* WHILE LOOPS *******
i = 1
while i < 6:  #Prints the statements until the condition becomes true
  print(i)
  i += 1

#NOTE: while loop runs until the condition becomes true. If the confition doesn't become false it will run an infinite loop. 
# Example:
while 5>3:
    print("hi")
